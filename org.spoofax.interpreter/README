Stratego/J is an interpreter for the Stratego language, written in Java. It
allows you to execute programs compiled with the Stratego compiler on the Java
runtime. It is compliant with version 0.17 of the Stratego language. 

A notable feature of the Stratego/J interpreter is that it can supports
rewriting of any tree-like or graph-like structure, if you provide it with a
proper adapter.

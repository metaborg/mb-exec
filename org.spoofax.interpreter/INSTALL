 Compilation
=============

There are two alternatives for compiling this package. The first is
to import the package into Eclipse.

The second is to use the Ant build tool. In this case, you will need
to execute the following steps:

1) Fetch ant-junit-1.6.5.jar and junit-3.8.1.jar from 
   http://www.ii.uib.no/~karltk/spoofax/extras/
   and place them into ext/

2) Compile the jar with 
   ant -f build/build.xml jar
   
   This will produce the file interpreter-x.y.z.jar in the root 
   directory of this project. 

3) Compile the unit tests by entering the tests/ directory and
   executing
   make
   (This requires strc to be in your path.)

3) Execute the unit tests with ant 
   ant -f build/build.xml run.tests

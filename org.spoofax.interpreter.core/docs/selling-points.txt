- Unified framework for source-code manipulation that scales through
  * inspection, as exemplified by source code documentation;
  * generation, as exemplified by generative programming and active libraries;
  * manipulation, as exemplified by source code refactoring

- Source code refactoring and compiler optimisations must be behaviourally
  preserving within the strictest interpretation of the language. This precludes
  many high-yield domain-specific optimisations and refactorings.
  This short-coming has been attempted rectified by the construction of active
  libraries. Spoofax is a tool develop active libraries.

- A vehicle for grafting DSL capabilities onto existing languages
- Lisp allows for in-syntax, in-language meta-programming, spoofax allows for
  out-syntax, out-language meta-programming, that may be language-independent

- Spoofax is a research vehicle for exploring fundamental properties of
  programming languages (not programming and software engineering).
